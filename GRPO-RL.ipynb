    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on tutorial, you'll learn how to improve a Large Language Model's ability to solve math problems using a technique called **GRPO**. This involves generating multiple answers to the same question, comparing answers to find which are better, and teaching the model to prefer better approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will build a comprehensive reward system for training a Large Language Model to solve math problems using GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization). This involves creating sophisticated reward functions that can evaluate model responses across different quality levels and implementing a complete GRPO training pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Extract Numerical Answers from Model Responses:** Implement robust parsing to extract numerical answers from various response formats including GSM8K standard format and common answer phrases.\n",
    "* **Analyze Response Quality Indicators:** Build a quality analysis system that detects mathematical reasoning, step-by-step thinking, and structured solutions in model responses.\n",
    "* **Reward Unparseable Responses:** Create a reward system for responses without clear numerical answers, based on effort and reasoning quality.\n",
    "* **Reward High-Quality Correct Answers:** Implement a bonus system that encourages not just correctness but also clear mathematical communication and detailed explanations.\n",
    "* **Implement Partial Credit for Wrong Answers:** Develop a partial credit system that provides learning gradients for wrong answers based on proximity to correct solutions and quality of reasoning shown."

    "The first critical component of your reward model is the ability to extract numerical answers from the model's generated text. Language models often produce verbose responses with explanations, calculations, and natural language, but you need to identify and extract the actual numerical answer to compare it with the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the basic implementation only looks for answers in the GSM8K standard format (marked with ####). However, models don't always follow this format perfectly. Your task is to implement a more robust extraction system that can handle various answer formats that models might produce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider implementing patterns to match common answer phrases like \"The answer is X\", \"equals X\", \"total is X\", or \"Therefore, X\". Remember to handle edge cases such as numbers with commas (e.g., 1,000), dollar signs, negative numbers, and decimal points (you can use this regular expression: `r'([+-]?\\d+(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?)'`). As a fallback strategy, you might want to extract the last number mentioned in the response, but make sure your regex pattern is sophisticated enough to properly identify valid numbers."

    "### Exercise 2: Analyze Response Quality Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Before assigning rewards to model responses, you need to understand what makes a good mathematical solution. This exercise focuses on building a comprehensive quality analysis system that examines various aspects of the generated response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement quality indicators that can detect whether a response contains mathematical reasoning. The current implementation has basic checks, but you should enhance it to identify mathematical operations (not just symbols like +, -, *, / but also words like \"multiply\", \"divide\", \"add\", \"subtract\"), reasoning indicators (words like \"first\", \"then\", \"next\", \"finally\" that show step-by-step thinking), and structured solutions (numbered steps or bullet points).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, consider counting meaningful metrics like the number of sentences (which might indicate detailed explanation), checking for the presence of numbers (essential for math problems), and measuring response length. These quality indicators will be crucial for the reward functions in the following exercises, as they help distinguish between different types of responses even when you can't extract a final answer."

    "### Exercise 3: Reward Unparseable Responses\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all model responses will contain a clear numerical answer that you can extract. Sometimes the model might provide a detailed explanation without a final answer, give up with \"I don't know\", or produce garbled output. The current implementation harshly gives 0.0 reward to all unparseable responses, which doesn't help the model learn what aspects of its response were good or bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a nuanced reward system for unparseable responses. Use the quality indicators from Exercise 2 to provide graduated rewards. For instance, if a response is lengthy (over 200 characters) and contains calculations, it shows the model is attempting to solve the problem and deserves some credit (perhaps 0.2). If it has reasoning and numbers but no clear answer, it might deserve 0.1. Very short responses (under 20 characters) are likely dismissive responses like \"I don't know\" and should receive 0.0. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Exercise 5: Implement Partial Credit for Wrong Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "This is perhaps the most critical exercise for effective GRPO training. The current implementation gives 0.0 reward to all wrong answers, which means the model learns nothing from near-misses or partially correct solutions. This binary reward system (1.0 for correct, 0.0 for wrong) makes learning extremely difficult and slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement a sophisticated partial credit system based on how close the wrong answer is to being correct. Start by calculating the relative error between the predicted and correct answers. Responses within 1% of the correct answer should receive 0.9 reward (they're almost right!), within 10% should get 0.7, and within 30% should get 0.5. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, check if the answer is at least in the right order of magnitude (between 0.1x and 10x the correct answer) and give 0.3 reward if so. Any reasonable attempt should get at least 0.1 reward. Finally, add a bonus of 0.1 if the response shows work (has calculations and steps) even though the final answer is wrong - this encourages the model to show its reasoning, making it easier to debug and improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "This graduated reward system is essential for GRPO because it provides a learning gradient - the model can learn that some wrong answers are \"less wrong\" than others and gradually improve toward the correct solution."

    "Here's how GRPO training works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate Multiple Answers**: For each question, generate 12 different answers\n",
    "2. **Score Each Answer**: Use your reward model to grade each one\n",
    "3. **Compare Within Group**: See which answers are better than others\n",
    "4. **Update Model**: Teach it to prefer the better answers\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of saying \"this answer is worth 0.7 points\", GRPO says \"Answer #3 is better than answers #1, #2, #4, #5...\". This relative comparison is more stable and effective than scoring each answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trainer**: Orchestrates the training process\n",
    "2. **Reward Function**: Grades the generated answers\n",
    "3. **Configuration**: All your settings from earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the `GRPOConfig()` within the `create_grpo_trainer()` function. This is where you set various parameters such as the temperature, as you have seen in the video."

    "\n",
    "You've successfully:\n",
    "- ✅ Implemented GRPO from scratch\n",
    "- ✅ Trained a 7B parameter model\n",
    "- ✅ Improved math problem-solving accuracy\n",
    "- ✅ Learned modern RL techniques for LLMs\n",

    "### Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO is just one of many post-training techniques. The same principles you've learned here apply to:\n",
    "- **PPO** (Proximal Policy Optimization)\n",
    "- **DPO** (Direct Preference Optimization)\n",
    "- **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)\n",
    "\n",
    "The future of AI involves not just pre-training large models, but also fine-tuning them for specific tasks using techniques like GRPO. You're now equipped with the knowledge to be part of that future!\n",
