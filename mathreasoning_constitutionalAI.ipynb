    "In this lab, you'll build a pipeline that generates multiple solution approaches to math problems and then evaluates them using constitutional principles. This assignment will deepen your understanding of template engineering, solution diversity, and constitution alignment techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "You will implement a comprehensive constitutional AI system that generates diverse mathematical solutions and evaluates them against quality principles. Through hands-on exercises, you'll learn to engineer effective templates, create solution diversity, and apply constitutional principles to rank mathematical reasoning approaches. You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create Solution Templates:** Design prompt templates for generating Chain-of-Thought and verification-based solutions that encourage clear mathematical reasoning and answer checking.\n",
    "* **Generate Alternative Method Solutions:** Build dynamic prompts that analyze existing solutions and generate genuinely different mathematical approaches using varied problem-solving strategies.\n",
    "* **Implement Accuracy Assessment:** Create a robust numerical answer extraction system that compares model solutions against ground truth values with appropriate tolerance handling.\n",
    "* **Evaluate Solution Completeness:** Develop comprehensive scoring systems that assess intermediate steps, calculations, and explanatory reasoning in mathematical solutions using pattern recognition.\n",
    "* **Assess Verification Quality:** Use LLM-as-judge techniques to evaluate whether solutions include proper answer verification and sanity checking procedures.\n",
    "* **Measure Solution Novelty:** Implement comparative analysis to determine whether alternative solutions use genuinely different mathematical approaches rather than mere rewordings of existing methods."
